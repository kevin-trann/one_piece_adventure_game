This is a project I created for my Introduction to Java class. The game is based off the popular tv show "One Piece" and it lets you create your character and embark on an adeventure. You can choose to be a pirate or marine.
The game runs through the terminal and is a chance based game. The goal of the game is to gain as much bounty and berries as possible as a pirate or become a Fleet Admiral as a marine. 

Run the "ProjectOneTester.java" file in order to run the game

-make sure your java version is updated to the latest version
