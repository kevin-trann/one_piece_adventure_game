This is a project I created for my Tntroduction to Java class. The game is based off the popular tv show "One Piece" and it lets you create your character and embark on an adeventure! You can choose to be a pirate or marine.
The game runs through the terminal and is a "luck" based game. The goal of the game is to gain as much bounty and berries as a pirate and for a marine; to become a Fleet Admiral. Have fun!

Run the "ProjectOneTester.java" file in order to run the game!
